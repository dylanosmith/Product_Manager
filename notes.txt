Getting a project set up:


mkdir project folder
cd project folder

mkdir server folder
touch server.js

cd server folder
mkdir routes folder - stores all routes for each model/controller
mkdir controllers folder - stores all logic for our views
mkdir models folder - stores all models
mkdir config folder - stores mongoose config file

npm installs (at root of project for server-side functionality)

npm init -y : creates node package.json file

npm install express

npm install mongoose (ORM for MongoDB)

npm install cors

Every model gets a controller file and a routes file


server.js file: 

General setup

const express = require("express")
const cors = require('cors')
const app = express();

//cors
app.use(cors())

//routes go here
require("./server/routes/person.routes")(app)

//starting server on port 8000
app.listen(8000, () => {
    console.log("listening on port 8000");
})


ROUTES 
general setup for a routes file - you'll want api routes for
CRUD 
import the controller for that model

const PersonController = require("../controllers/person.controller");

//make a single function for all routes
module.exports = function(app) => {
    app.get for finding all
    app.get for finding one
    app.post for creating a new instance of a model
    app.put for update
    app.delete for deleting
}

CONTROLLERS
